            Pretty Easy Privacy (PEP) is a service for encrypting data. That's
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have a file you want to securely store on you machine or Google
            Drive? PEP makes passphrase protecting files and text simple.

            But, how?

            without the headache. Don't know what that means? Trust us, it's a
            headache.
          </p>
          <p>
            At it's core, PEP offers three simple input forms: encryption, decryption, and key generation.

            No, we aren't a messaging service.

            The focus of PEP is file and object security. We take the strength
            of PGP encryption, but leave out the flaws of the{" "}

            PEP is a simple and very effective way to passphrase (or key)
            encrypt your information.
          </p>

          <p>
            PEP doesn't try to be a messaging service. For messaging we
            recommend sticking to applications using the{" "}

            Wait, why should I trust you with my data?

            The site is statically hosted entirely on github.
            <b> No data is being transferred from your device to a server. </b>

            Can I recover my data if this site goes away?
          </Typography>
          <p>Yes.</p>
          <p>
            Since PEP uses OpenPGPJS, most OpenPGP derivatives should be able to
            decrypt your files.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few examples are: <b>Gpg4win</b> for windows, <b>Mac GPG</b> for
            mac, or just plain <b>GnuPG</b> for linux distros.
          </p>
          <p>So why not just use these to handle encryption?</p>
          <p>
            They are cumbersome and lack a user interface. However, they will
            decrypt your data for you should this site disappear.

              At the moment all symmetric passphrase encryption with PEP uses
              AES 256 encryption via{" "}

              .
            </p>
            <p>Asymmetric encryption is also handled via openPGP.js</p>
            <p>
              Currently all asymmetric keys generated are RSA 4096 bits. If
              additional encryption algorithms or bit lengths are needed, drop a
              line in github. We can add them in real quick.
            </p>
            <p>
              And yes, we know there is no key signing. For messaging and
              communication we strongly encourage some of the apps noted above.
