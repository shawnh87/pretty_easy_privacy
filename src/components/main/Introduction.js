            Pretty Easy Privacy (PEP) is a simple service for encrypting data.
            That's it.

          <p>
            Have a file you want to securly store on you machine or Google
            Drive? PEP make passphrase protecting files and text simple.

            headache.
          </p>
          <p>
            At it's core, PEP offers three simple input forms: Passphrase file
            encryption, Asymetric file encryption, and Key Generation.

          <p>Please don't trust us.</p>

            The site is staticly hosted entirly on github.
            <b> No data is being transfered from your device to a server. </b>

          <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>
            Can I recover my data if this site goes away?
          </Typography>
          <p>Yes.</p>
          <p>
            Since PEP uses OpenPGPJS, most OpenPGP derivatives should be able to
            decrypt your files.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few examples are: <b>Gpg4win</b> for windows, <b>Mac GPG</b> for
            mac, or just plain <b>GnuPG</b> for linux distros.
          </p>
          <p>
            So why not just use these to handle encryption? They are cumbersome
            and lack a user interface. However, the will get your data for you
            if this site were to disapear.

              .
            </p>
            <p>Assymetric encryption is also handled via openPGP.js</p>
            <p>
              Currently all asymetric keys generated are RSA 4096 bits. If
              additional encryption algoritms or bit lengths are needed, drop a
              line in github. We can add them in real quick.

            <p>
              And yes, we know there is no key signing. For messaging and
              communication we strongly encourage some of the app noted above.
