            What's this thing about keys?
          </Typography>
          <p>
            Keys, or key pairs are just an alternative method to using a
            passphrase. Like we mentioned above, at first you should just stick
            with passphrase encryption.
          </p>
          <p>
            Check the <b>Resources</b> section for more info on how asymmetric
            encryption works.
          </p>

              Getting Fancy with Asymmetry (this is definitely optional)
            </Typography>
            <p>
              We do offer asymmetric encryption decryption and key generation.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, head over to{" "}
              <Link component={RouterLink} to={"/resource"}>
                <b>Resources</b>
              </Link>{" "}
              and learn a bit about how this works.
            </p>
            <p>Alright, got it? Good.</p>

            <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>

            <p>
              Of course not! We will give you a 4096 bit RSA key for free! Visit{" "}

                <b>Key Generation</b>

              and fill out the form. That's it!
            </p>
            <p>
              Use any name or email address you want. Remember, this data

            </p>
            <p>
              The passphrase is how you can access your private key later for
              decryption.
            </p>
            <p>You will get two keys. One public and one private.</p>
            <p>
              You can give out the public key to your friends. It's sole purpose
              is to encrypt files that
              <b>only your private key and passphrase can decrypt</b>.
            </p>
            <Typography color="error">
              <b>NEVER GIVE OUT YOUR PRIVATE KEY!</b>

              Encrypt with asymmetry

              section. On the top, select Asymmetric.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now you should be good to go. The only difference from symmetric
              encryption is that you must input or upload a public key.
            </p>
            <p>Seriously. That's the only difference.</p>

            <p>
              Remember that top selector we mentioned for asymmetric encrytion?
              Same deal for decryption.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just fill out the form, let us know what format you expect the

              enter your <b>private key</b> and affiliated passphrase.
